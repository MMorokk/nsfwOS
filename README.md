# nsfwOS

It isn't really a distro, but it's an installation script that fully installs my dotfiles, dependencies, and programs. It is NOT SAFE FOR WORK because it's fully relying on git versions of programs and AUR.  Something WILL BREAK, so be sure to make backups of your files and stuff. Or just learn how to [fix arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page).

<mark>**WARNING:**</mark>

**DO NOT install it on your comlete installations of arch**
*This script meant to be installed on fresh system*

---

The script assumes that you just completed `archinstall` with:

- Bootloader: Grub

- Profile: Minimal

- Audio: Pipewire

- Network configuration: NetworkManager

- Optional repositories: multilib

  **Anything other than those parameners WILL NOT WORK**
